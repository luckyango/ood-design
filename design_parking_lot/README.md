🌟 Clarify requirements
“Before I start designing the system, let me clarify the requirements so we’re aligned.”

“What types of vehicles should we support? For example, motorcycles, cars, buses?”

“Do we have different parking spot sizes, such as small, compact, and large?”

“Do we want to track parking time and compute parking fees when a vehicle leaves?”

“Is this for a single parking lot?”

✅ 假设面试官回答：motorcycles, cars, buses；small/compact/large；yes to parking time & fee；single lot

“Great. So, I’ll design for motorcycles, cars, and buses, with parking spots of small, compact, or large sizes. We’ll track parking time for fee calculation, and focus on a single lot.”

🌟 Design explanation
“I will define the following classes: ParkingLot, ParkingSpot, Vehicle, and subclasses for Motorcycle, Car, and Bus.”

"ParkingLot: represents the entire lot, holds the parking spots."

"ParkingSpot: represents each individual spot, tracks its size, whether it’s occupied, and which vehicle is in it."

"Vehicle: an abstract class, with subclasses for motorcycle, car, and bus. Each vehicle tracks its plate, size, and entry time."

"The lot tries to find the first suitable spot when parking. When a vehicle leaves, we compute the parking fee based on its parking duration."

🌟 Code logic explanation
“When parking a vehicle, I scan the spots and park in the first available one that fits. When a vehicle leaves, I compute the fee based on how long it was parked.”

“I’m using a simple rule: one dollar per hour, rounded up.”
"I’ll define an enum for vehicle size..."
"Then, I’ll define an abstract Vehicle class and subclasses..."
"ParkingSpot will have size, occupied flag, and the vehicle reference..."
"ParkingLot will have a list of spots and handle park/leave operations."

🌟 Main example explanation
“In the main function, I create a lot with 5 small, 10 compact, and 3 large spots. I park a motorcycle, a car, and a bus. I simulate time passing, then remove the vehicles and print the fee.”
"Let me show how this would work. We initialize the lot with some spots of each type. We park a motorcycle, a car, and a bus. We simulate time passing and compute the fee when they leave."

🌟 Closing
“If I had more time, I would extend the design to include levels, faster spot search, reservations, or more complex fee structures.”
